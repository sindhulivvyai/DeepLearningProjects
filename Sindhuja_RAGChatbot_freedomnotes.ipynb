As detailed in the context, the march was a 24-day non-violent protest led by Mahatma Gandhi, commencing on March 12 and concluding on April 6, 1930. Gandhi, along with his followers, walked 387 kilometers from Sabarmati Ashram to the coastal village of Dandi.\n","\n","The primary purpose of the Salt March was to directly challenge and defy the British Salt Act of 1882, which gave the British government a monopoly on the production and sale of salt, effectively taxing Indian citizens on a basic necessity. By making salt from seawater at Dandi, Gandhi symbolically broke the law and encouraged others to do the same, representing a clear act of civil disobedience.\n","\n","**Significance in the Freedom Movement:**\n","\n","The context explicitly highlights the Salt March's importance in several ways:\n","\n","*   **Turning Point:** The march is described as a turning point in the Indian independence movement. It galvanized the nation and broadened the appeal of the freedom struggle, drawing in people from all walks of life.\n","*   **Global Attention:** The Salt March attracted worldwide attention to India's struggle for freedom. The visual spectacle of Gandhi and his followers peacefully defying British law resonated globally, exposing the injustice of British rule to an international audience.\n","*   **Catalyst for Civil Disobedience Movement:** The Salt March directly triggered the launch of the Civil Disobedience Movement (1930-1934). The success of the Salt March inspired people across the country to break other unjust British laws through non-violent resistance. This included boycotting British goods, refusing to pay taxes, and other forms of civil disobedience. The Civil Disobedience Movement, building on the foundation laid by the Salt March, significantly weakened British authority and furthered the cause of Indian independence.\n","\n","In summary, the Salt March was a meticulously planned act of defiance that resonated deeply with the Indian population and garnered international support. By challenging the British salt monopoly through a non-violent act of civil disobedience, the march served as a powerful catalyst for the Civil Disobedience Movement and a crucial turning point in India's fight for independence.\n","\n","\n","📚 Sources used (3 found):\n","\n","--- Source 1 (Relevance: 0.661) ---\n","The Salt March, also known as the Dandi March, was a 24-day non-violent protest led by Mahatma Gandhi from March 12 to April 6, 1930.

Further, he was willing to seek assistance from the Axis powers during World War II, indicating a pragmatic approach focused on leveraging any means necessary to overthrow British rule, even if it meant aligning with controversial international actors. His creation of the Provisional Government of Free India also underscores his desire for immediate and decisive action to establish an independent Indian state, even before the British officially relinquished control.\n","\n","*   **Gandhi's Approach:** The context describes Gandhi as the leader who \"employed nonviolent civil disobedience to lead India to independence.\" His philosophy of satyagraha (truth-force) was rooted in peaceful resistance, non-cooperation, and moral persuasion. Gandhi's approach emphasized changing the hearts and minds of the British through moral pressure and by making it impossible for them to continue ruling India with the consent of the governed.\n","\n","*   **Ideological Differences:** The context also notes that Bose \"had ideological differences with Gandhi's non-violent approach.\" This suggests a fundamental disagreement on the efficacy and morality of non-violence as a strategy for national liberation. Bose likely viewed Gandhi's approach as too slow, passive, and potentially ineffective against a powerful and entrenched colonial power.\n","\n","In essence, Bose was a revolutionary who believed in actively fighting for freedom, even through military means and external alliances, while Gandhi was a pacifist who sought independence through non-violent resistance and moral suasion.\n","\n","\n","📚 Sources used (3 found):\n","\n","--- Source 1 (Relevance: 0.714) ---\n","Subhas Chandra Bose (1897-1945) was an Indian nationalist who defied British authority in India and became a prominent leader of the Indian independence movement.
